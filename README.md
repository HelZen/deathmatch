# Deathmatch (Working Title)
> A shitty *Half-Life Deathmatch* inspired class based team shooter that should NOT exist.

A project made in Unity made to make our teacher happy. Also, we like half life.

### Installation
Unzip to a location that you can remember and open the .EXE file. Thats literally it.
